## Why

If only we had a frontend...

## Installation

Install and run [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/floris-alteza/bank-backend.git`

Start! `docker-compose up`

## Usage

Once the server has started the swagger documentation can be found at [http://localhost:3000/api/](http://localhost:3000/api/)

## TODO

Where can i start...

- Implement configs
- Tests
- Clean up code
- Use Nestjs how it is intended (this is a first try)
